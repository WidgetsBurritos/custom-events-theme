# Custom Events Sub Theme

This is a simple Drupal 7 subtheme built for the purposes of illustrating Unit Testing and Functionality Testing.

This theme requires the base [Bootstrap theme](https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap).

This theme should be used in tandem with the [Customs Event Module](https://github.com/WidgetsBurritos/custom-events-module)

**This is by no means a complete theme, and should not be relied upon in a production environment. It is solely for educational purposes.
